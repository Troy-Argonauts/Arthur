# 2022 Rapid React - Arthur

This year was a blast, with it being our rookie year, and learning all sorts of topics. We learned from bottom up, from what the CAN Bus is, to how to tune PID and Limelight.
Without some teams who had previous years and even this year's game open source, we wouldn't have been as successful. To help out future rookie teams, or just teams who need
some inspiration, linked below is all of their GitHubs.
